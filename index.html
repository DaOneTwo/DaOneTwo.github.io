                    Getting started programming in python is relatively simple. We will need a few things throughout the
                    life of this class. If at all possible it would be great if you could get your system ready Before
                    the first day of class. I am including some links and basic instructions for PC's (Windows)
                    and Macs (OSX) operating systems.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">Items we will need are...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python 3.8 version</li>
                    <li>Basic Text Editor</li>

                        <p>These instructions are assuming you are running Windows 10. Running an older version things
                            should be very similar but if you run into any issues we may need to work through those
                            together.</p>
                        <p>The youtube video linked below is a great quick tutorial on how to install python on your
                            windows system. It is not hard to do but there are aq few options that may cause you some
                            heartburn. Watching the video may help with that. Just a couple quick bullet points
                            regarding the video.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When he says type win S he means press the windows key and allow the menu to come up.
                            </li>
                            <li> you can use the direct link to the get to the downloads page for the proper version
                            </li>
                            <li>Select all the options he selects. Install for all users, and add python to the path are
                                the key items needed.
                            </li>

                        <p class="card-text">OSX actually comes with a system level python. Most developers leave it
                            alone so nothing gets messed up. They will install the versions they need/want through a
                            variety of ways. The easiest way is through a package manager called Homebrew. This is the
                            way I am going to recommend. This is all done from a command line. There is a link to a
                            youtube video that shows step 2 and 3 at the bottom of this section.

                    that can be worked through. This is likely how we will use it most.</p>
