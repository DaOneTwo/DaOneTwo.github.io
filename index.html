                    Getting started programming in python is relatively simple. We will need a few things throughout the
                    life of this class. If at all possible it would be great if you could get your system ready Before
                    the first day of class. I am including some links and basic instructions for PC's (Windows)
                    and Macs (OSX) operating systems.

                <p class="card-text">Items we will need are...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python 3.8 version</li>
                    <li>Basic Text Editor</li>
                    <li>PyCharm Education Edition</li>

                        <p>These instructions are assuming you are running Windows 10. If you are running an older
                            version of Windows please contact me as we will likely need to do things a little
                            differently.</p>
                        <h5>Python install version 3.8</h5>
                        <p>Installing python has been getting easier and easier. Installing it today is as easy as
                            installing it in the Windows Store. (The windows store version does have a few limitations
                            but we are VERY unlikely to run into them during this course.   A link to the store is provided below.

                    Sound Maker is a simple Client/Server Application that was built to be a simple and fun
                    introduction to Python for students. There is a Text-To-Speech server
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The client was kept pure python on purpose to try to help get the absolute beginner
                    to the excitement
                    of executing code to make another computer on the network do something.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Running the server requires installing the dependencies in the requirements.txt
                    file.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Using the buttons below students can download the files needed in a simple .zip
                    format. This will
                    reduce the barrier to entry. A link to the git repo is also provided for those with more advanced
                    capabilities.</p>
