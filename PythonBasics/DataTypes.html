<h1 style="margin:1.3em 0 1em;padding:0;font-weight:bold;font-size:1.6em;border-bottom:1pt solid #DDDDDD;">Python Data Types</h1>
<p style="margin:1.2em 0;">Understanding the data types and structures within any language are
critical to be effective at utilizing it to it's fullest.</p>
<p style="margin:1.2em 0;">Python has it's primary &quot;built in&quot; data types and then those have been
expanded upon greatly for various needs and reasons.</p>
<p style="margin:1.2em 0;">The objective this week is to go through the Intro to Programming course
in the Pycharm Edu edition you downloaded and installed.</p>
<p style="margin:1.2em 0;">In this course you will be guided through the basics of the python
language, learning about the primary data types and language syntax.</p>
<p style="margin:1.2em 0;">If you do not have Pycharm Educational edition you will need to download
it from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/education/download/#section=pycharm-edu">here.</a></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li>Open the Pycharm Edu program.</li>
</ul>
<pre style="font-family:Consolas,Inconsolata,Courier,monospace;font-size:1em;line-height:1.3em;margin:1.2em 0;"><code class="text" style="background-color:#f8f8f8;border-radius:3px;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;font-family:Consolas,Inconsolata,Courier,monospace;font-size:0.9em;margin:0 0.15em;overflow:auto;padding:0.5em 0.7em;white-space:pre;color:#444;"># windows

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li style="margin:1em 0 1em 0;">
    <p style="margin:0;">If you are opening it for the first time you may get asked som
    questions. Complete what is needed . Defaults are fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin:1em 0 1em 0;">
    <p style="margin:0;">You should finally end up at a landing page that looks like the imag*
    below. Your screen may not say <em>&quot;Learn and Teach&quot;</em> but it should be
    similar. Under it select <em>&quot;Browse courses&quot;</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:1.2em 0;"><img src="./browse_courses.png" class="img-responsive" alt="project

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li>If Intro to python is not preselected search for it using the search*
    box. When selected click the join button.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li>Accept any defaults that you are asked to provide until you arrive
    at something like the image you see below.</li>
</ul>
<img src="./Fullscreen.png" class="img-responsive" alt="application view">
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li style="margin:1em 0 1em 0;">
    <p style="margin:0;">That view above is the main course view. It consists of 3 parts. The
    course files, the code editor, and the instructions and test runners.</p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin:1em 0 1em 0;">
    <p style="margin:0;">You can jump around in the course but I would not recommend it for
    beginners. It will be best for you to go through and complete each
    section. The portions you have not completed will have an empty
    checkbox. The ones you have completed successfully will fill in with
    green as you see in the picture below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<img src="./Course.png" class="img-responsive" alt="course view">
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li>In the center is the code you will need to edit for the exercise. See
    the play button in the top right? Clicking it will run the code in that
    file similar to what we have previously done in the command line with
    <code style="background-color:#f8f8f8;border-radius:2px;padding:1px 2px 0 2px;border:1px solid #e0e0e0;font-family:Consolas,Inconsolata,Courier,monospace;font-size:0.9em;color:#444;">python3 &lt;filename&gt;.py</code>. The results of your fule running will appear in
    the console panel at the bottom. It can be expanded or minimized as you
    desire. The play button that appears there will also re run your code.</li>
</ul>
<img src="./Code.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Editor">
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left:1em;padding-left:0.5em;text-indent:0;">
  <li>In the right panel is the section instructions. It will tell you a
    little about the &quot;challenge&quot; for the section and teach you what is
    expected. When you think you have what they are asking for in your
    code window you can press the Check button at the bottom of this
    section. This will run some tests on your code and result in a
    pass/fail. Once you have passed click the next button and move to
    the next section. If at any point you feel like you need to review
    a previous section hop back over to it by double clicking that
    section in the course view on the far left.</li>
